## Project Overview
- This Sudoku project in Python aimed to develop a functional Sudoku game. Working in a team of 4, we implement random board generation, state checking, and visuals using PyGame. A learning opportunity to practice the programming skills we have learned this semester, by working with external libraries and improve out problem-solving skills.

## Project Goals
**The primary objectives of this project were to:** <br>
- Build a Sudoku solver in Python capable of solving puzzles with different difficulty levels.
- Design a user-friendly interface (graphical user interfaces)  for seamless puzzle input and display.

## Challenges 
- Throughout the project, there was a small learning curve in using the pygame module and how to implement the functionality of adding notes and removing those notes to change those cells to the correct value.

## Learning Outcomes
**The project provided valuable learning experiences, including:** <br>
- Improved proficiency in debugging and optimizing code for efficiency.
- Gained insights into user interface design and user experience considerations.
- How to commit, fork, push, and pull the working repository and make changes to code.

## Conclusion
Through this endeavor, my programming skills were put to the test, and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this Sudoku project. Coding has always been a passion of mine, and this project allowed me to immerse myself in my love for problem-solving and software development.
