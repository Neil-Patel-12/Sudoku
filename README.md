# Sudoku Project

## Project Overview
- This Sudoku project in Python aimed to develop a functional Sudoku game. Working in a team of 4, we implement random board generation, state checking, and visuals using PyGame. A learning opportunity to practice the programming skills we have learned this semester, by working with external libraries and improve out problem-solving skills.

## Project Goals
**The primary objectives of this project were to:** <br>
- Build a Sudoku solver in Python capable of solving puzzles with different difficulty levels.
- Design a user-friendly interface (graphical user interfaces)  for seamless puzzle input and display.

## Challenges 
- Throughout the project, there was a small learning curve in using the pygame module and how to implement the functionality of adding notes and removing those notes to change those cells to the correct value.

## Learning Outcomes
**The project provided valuable learning experiences, including:** <br>
- Improved proficiency in debugging and optimizing code for efficiency.
- Gained insights into user interface design and user experience considerations.

## Conclusion
Through this endeavor, my programming skills were put to the test, and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this Sudoku project. Coding has always been a passion of mine, and this project allowed me to immerse myself in my love for problem-solving and software development.

### Steps:
1. When you go to the github repository we provided, on the top right hand corner of the screen, there is a button that says "Fork". That will fork the repo to your own github and allow you to work on the project by adding your own files to the repository

## REPLIT Instructions

### Steps:
1. Go to [https://replit.com/~](https://replit.com/~) and create a free account
2. In the top left corner of the home page, select the dropdown and click the 'Create' button
3. In the Create window, click "Import from GitHub" in the top right corner of the box
4. Copy and paste your github url from the base of your repository into the box, and click "Import from GitHub"
5. You should be able to run your pygame project in Replit as long as the main file is called "sudoku.py". If it is named something different, either rename it to 'sudoku.py' or change the run command in the 'main.sh' file to run your filename instead
6. Happy Coding:)

## Joined Programming Instructions

### Steps:
1. When working on a replit project, there is a button on the top right side of the page called "Invite"
2. When you click that button, you can click "generate a join link" and give that to your groupmates to code on the same screen together
3. You can also invite them by email, but the join link is easier
